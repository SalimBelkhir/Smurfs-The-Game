I am currently developing an RPG game without a game engine in C++ using the SDL2 library, where you can play with a smurf character. The project is still in progress.
For now, you can control the smurf to move forward and backward, and he can jump too. All this is done with fluent animation, plus I added the camera slide that follows the actions of your smurf.
